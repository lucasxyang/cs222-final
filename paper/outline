- Intro / Motivation
  Theory class, be explicit
  What is a WSN
  How do they differ from traditional networks
  Radio dominates power
  Low vs. high data rates
  Why haven't people looked at this before?
  Scientists want the raw data
- related work
  Traditional compression schemes
  Things that have been tried
  LZ77 (try top -k compression)
  S-LZW
  Mini-low....
  They work on pattern matching
  noisy data
  limited memory
  (sending uncompressed data to neighbor)
- block delta encoding
  describe
  advantages:
  works
  simple to implement
  low memory overhead
  low computation
- experiments/results
  block size across all 3 data sets
  compression (how well we do)
  energy (how much does it save)
-future work
-conclusion
