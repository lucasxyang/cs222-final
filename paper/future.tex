\section{Future Work}

In this we showed how noise makes LZ77 an impractical compression
scheme in Wireless Sensor Networking. In the future we would like to
investigate a hybrid compression scheme where you would perform LZ77
on the higher order bits, and encode the lower order bits
separately. There are many issues related to this scheme. For example,
how would you fit the data into a small packet? How would you align
the lower and higher order bits? How energy efficient would that be?
These questions require further investigation, and would certainly be
an interesting topic for future exploration.

In our paper we analyzed our data sets using three traditional
compression schemes: LZ77, RLE, and Huffman coding. This was not a
exhaustive analysis of all the compression schemes that exist. In
future work, we would like to perform the same analysis with a larger
number of compression schemes. It is possible that there already
exists a compression algorithm that is well suited for Wireless Sensor
Networks that we have not tested.
